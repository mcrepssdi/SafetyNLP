Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be defined as a collection of interconnectedlayers, neurons and weighted connections.
Each layer is connected to the previouslayer by weighted connections that couple each neuron in a layer to the next neuronin the adjacent layer.
An ANN resembles a human brain with multiple interconnectedsynapses which allow for the signal to easily flow from one neuron to the next.
Thereare two distinct constructs which an ANN can assume; they can be thought of asSupervised and Unsupervised networks. Supervised neural networks have knownoutcomes
while Unsupervised neural networks have unknown outcomes. This thesiswill primarily focus on Supervised neural networks.The contributions of this thesis are two-fold.
One, it offers a comprehensive studyof Object-oriented Programming (OOP) design principles that have been employedto design ANNs. Two, it designs and implements a scalable
OOP solution to ANNs.The ANN solution presented in this thesis provides an efficient and accurate statisticalprediction model. A Multi-layer feed-forward neural network using
back-propagationis used to demonstrate OOP design techniques. The neural network consists of threelayers: one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer.
 The input layerconsists of two neurons; the hidden layer consists of three neurons; while the outputlayer consists of one neutron. The neural network utilizes the Sigmoid function asiii
 the activation function so that all data points are normalized to values between [0,1].Compared to two existing models (Encog and Neuroph), the approach in this workproduces a more accurate prediction.
